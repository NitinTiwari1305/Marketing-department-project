One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs. By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs. If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation.

All data collected and ussed is from ssecondary source.
